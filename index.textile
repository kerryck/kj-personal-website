h2. Hello World!

I'm Kerryck Jones. I recently completed a <mark class="do">software engineering</mark> degree from the University of Waterloo (w00t!). I'm currently taking some time off before starting work @ <a href="http://www.inkling.com">Inkling</a> where I'll be back to doing web wizardry. <mark class="do">Exciting stuff!</mark>

Other exciting stuff: I'm planning on biking across Canada and down too San Francisco this summer. <mark class="do">Training</mark> is going well and the rest time allows for some spare hours to tackle <mark class="make">a few side projects</mark> I've been meaning to take a stab at.

If you have any questions ping <mark class="contact">me@kerryck.com</mark>
