h2. Hello World!

I'm Kerryck Jones, a <mark class="do">software engineering</mark> student at the University of Waterloo. I just finished up my second workterm of javascript wizardry @ "Inkling":http://www.inkling.com and I'm currently enjoying my last school term. I will be joining the real world of work in April. <mark class="do">Exciting stuff!</mark>

If you're looking for me this term I will probably be in a lab somewhere building a <mark class="make">"Joos compiler":http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs444/</mark> or finishing up my <mark class="make">forth year design project</mark>. Either that or I'll be in the gym training for <mark class="do">parkour</mark> and playing <mark class="do">intramurals</mark> with my fellow software engineers.

If you have any questions ping <mark class="contact">me@kerryck.com</mark>
