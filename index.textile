h2. Hello World!

I'm Kerryck Jones. It's been a busy year. I graduated as a software engineer from the University of Waterloo. I biked across Canada on a pilgrimage to San Francisco where I have currently started working @ <a href="http://www.inkling.com">Inkling</a>. Exciting stuff!

Otherwise I'm still doing <a href="http://baparkour.ning.com/events">parkour</a>. Still <a href="https://github.com/kerryck">coding</a> for kicks. Oh and I've recently been taking an <a href="https://class.coursera.org/modernpoetry/class/index">online poetry course</a>. It's a slight departure from engineering studies but also quite <a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/encounter.html">The Encounter.</a>

If you have any questions ping <mark class="contact">me@kerryck.com</mark>
