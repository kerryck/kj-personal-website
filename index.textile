h2. Hello World!

I'm Kerryck Jones, a software engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm currently hacking away on Javascript and other web wizardy work @ Inkling.

This website will be devoted to unleashing some of my ideas and projects onto the world. It's not much now, but there will be much more to come.

If you have any questions hit me up at me@kerryck.com
